    <p>My lovely book <br>
    Running through the field <br>
    Where are you going with your pages blowing in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
    I want to shower in exposition dumps<br>
    And read you over fences<br>
    Polish your bridge every single day<br>
    And take you to the book dentist
    </p>
    <p>
    My lovely, lovely, lovely book (my lovely book)<br>
    You're a booklet no more
    </p>
    <p>
    Running around<br>
    With a blurb on your back<br>
    Austen, Jane or Will Wight<br>
